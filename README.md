**Reproducibility Package for Lageson and Apel (2025)**

This repository contains the data and programs to reproduce tables and figures in "The Mark or Trace of a Criminal Record: A Survey Experiment of Race and Criminal Record Signaling," which appears in *Criminology*. This is a two-part study of the impact of a criminal record on hiring. Part 1 is a meta-review of prior criminal record hiring experiments, to document long-term patterns in hiring discrimination by a criminal record, by race, and by the intersection of a criminal record with race. Part 2 is a novel survey experiment conducted on YouGov to assess the impact of a formal criminal record (conveyed by a criminal background report), an informal criminal record (conveyed by a search engine "hit" for an arrest record), and applicant race on willingness to hire.
